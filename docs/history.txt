Events form a network of causes and consequences
Events have a propogation speed (light cone) that determines how quickly they can interact with entities

Events are the result of interactions between entities, or interactions between events.
Events could be thought of as a type of temporal entity

[Don't try to solve the creation of the universe first. Begin with birth events.]

Event scope can be 'specific' or 'aggregate'

Two entities in a region have a chance to interact proportional to their coupling energy.

Try to describe the behavior of clusters of entities using statistical mechanics.

Events are themselves entities that can interact with each other. How should this be described?

Event influence cones propogate at the speed of information.
In physics, the speed of information is typically light, and so we talk about light cones.
In human terms, it is significantly slower than light, and not a constant
it is a function of the method of propogation

We are always moving at the speed of light, but mostly through the time dimension.

It takes time to send messages to actors, and yet more time to find out news about the results of their actions
The speed of communication technology should have a direct impact on the responsiveness of the game.
To make up for the lack of responsiveness at a distance, there should be a richer world of response at a local dilate

On the other hand, this also serves to gate complexity over the course of the game.
The world begins populated, but closed off because the speed of information is slow.
As the speed of information increases, the world opens up, and this process is world discovery.
This should have some representation in how the world is drawn.

Space begins highly curved and flattens out over time, but the speed of communication also begins slow, so it may be hard to see that.

An object in motion stays in motion
Is history a phase space?
